# js-workshop
 Practice programming and logical skills...

# before you start
* execute `npm i`

# how to use:
* There is a folder named `questions` inside which there is a list of folders with tasks (each folder is task name)
* inside each folder is a `readme.md` file which describes a specific task
* inside each folder there is a `tests.js` description file which describes test cases which should pass with your solution
* create your solution for a specific problem described in the `readme.md` file and add a solution `.js` file with your name at the question folder
* `.js` file should follow pattern `module.exports = function (param) { // your code here }` (it should export solution function)
* after your solution is ready you can test it simply by typing `npm run check` in the terminal of the root of the project
* first you will need to choose the task in the terminal
* after that you will see tests passing or failing for all solutions in a selected task

# push changes
