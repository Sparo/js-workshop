# js-workshop
 Practice programming and logical skills...

# requironments
 `node -v lts` - so you can use latest JS features
 `npm` - whichever comes with `lts` `node`

# before you start
* execute `npm i`

# how to use:
* There is a folder named `questions` inside which there is a list of subfolders with tasks (each subfolder is task name)
* inside each of the task subfolders there is a `readme.md` file which describes a specific task
* inside each of the task subfolders there is a `tests.js` description file that **describes test cases** which should pass your solution
* create your solution for a specific problem described in the `readme.md` file and add a solution `.js` file with your name at the question subfolder
* `.js` file code should follow pattern `module.exports = function (...params) { // your code here }` (solution should export function)
* after your solution is ready you can test it simply by typing `npm run check` in the terminal of the root of the project
* first you will need to choose the task/question you want to validate in the terminal
* after that you will see tests passing or failing for all solutions of the selected task
